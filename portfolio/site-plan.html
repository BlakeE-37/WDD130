        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Blake Hollingsworth, and I am a computer programmer. I have a beautiful fianc√© that I love very
            much, and will be married to on January 14th 2023. I attend BYU-Idaho, studying for a computer science
            degree, and my estimated year for graduation is 2024. Some of my hobbies include fishing, longboarding, rock
            climbing, playing video games and board games, and of course, anything that deals with computers. I am a big
            problem solver, and I love to learn new things. If I see a problem that I am unsure of how to fix, I can
            guarantee I will be doing research, until I can identify and fix the problem. This part of my personality
            has proven to help a lot with my search for computer programming and computer hardware knowledge. Above all,
            it is my goal in life to be as flexible as possible by being able to tackle any problem that comes my way.
            This includes learning things like cooking and woodworking, but also more computer related topics such as,
            building circuits, soldering, understanding networking, different operating systems and more computer
            programming languages.
            I have always had a love for technology, whether it be playing video games, surfing the internet or just
            looking through the possible settings of my computer or cell phone. Growing up I was always so curious about
            how computers worked and how to fix them when they weren&#2019;t working. Since going to college, I have
            been able
            to dive deeper into these curiosities and learn a lot about computers. I have been taking many programming
            classes that have shown me that this career path is right for me. Going along with that idea, I am also very
            interested in Design. This stems from the experiences I had in high school. For all four years of high
            school, I took Yearbook class. The web design and graphic design aspects of yearbook creation are what
            caught my attention. Combining my two interests has been my plan since high school. A career that combines
            graphic design and computer programming would interest me greatly, although a career anywhere in computer
            information technology or computer programming would be satisfactory. Although I love to program, what I
            love more is to learn new things. Lately I have been really interested in cybersecurity and have been
            learning tools such as Nmap and Wireshark. I have also been familiarizing myself with virtual machines,
            Linux commands and the Linux OS.

        <h3>My Experience</h3>
        <p>
            The programming languages that I have experience with are Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, C#, and
            Kotlin. Although I have used all of these languages in the past, I am much more comfortable in languages
            such as Python, JavaScript and HTML. I am also well versed in GitHub and Git commands, and I often use
            Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider. Some other tools I am familiar with but don&#2019;t use often are
            Android
            Studio Code, and Arduino IDE.
            Over the summer of 2022, I was hired for an internship with the company, Nespon Solutions. This company
            offers IT solutions to its clients, as they are a distributor of Salesforce and hire Salesforce developers
            for their clients. My role at Nespon Solutions was to not only do the regular things an Intern does, but to
            also use my knowledge of computers and IT to help out around the office. While working at Nespon I became
            familiar with many Microsoft applications such as Microsoft teams, Outlook, and SharePoint. But in my
            opinion the most important tool I learned at Nespon Solutions was Azure Active Directory. This tool is how
            Nespon Solutions manages its employees and it&#2019;s Microsoft tenant. I became an admin for their system
            and
            received many opportunities to look around the Azure AD application to identify what was possible and how I
            could help with the companies IT needs. I was able to setup things like Single-Sign On (SSO), dynamic
            groups, and I even created a new SharePoint Site for the company. Working for Nespon Solutions opened my eye
            to what IT in the real world looks like and helped me understand what I wanted to learn more about.
