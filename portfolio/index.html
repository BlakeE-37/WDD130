                <h2>My Programming Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>
                        The programming languages that I have experience with are Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++,
                        C#,
                        and Kotlin. Although I have used all of these languages in the past, I am much more comfortable
                        in
                        languages such as Python, JavaScript and HTML.<br><br>I am also well versed in GitHub and Git
                        commands,
                        and
                        I often use Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider. Some other tools I am familiar with but
                        don&#x27;t
                        use often are Android Studio Code, and Arduino IDE.<br><br>
                        Many of my projects that I have made with these tools can be found on my <a

                    </p>
                    <h2>My IT Experience</h3>
                        <img class="textImg" src="./images/nespon-building.jpg" alt="Nespon Building">
                        <p>
                            Over the summer of 2022, I was hired for an internship with the company, Nespon Solutions.
                            This
                            company offers IT solutions to its clients, as they are a distributor of Salesforce and hire
                            Salesforce developers for their clients. My role at Nespon Solutions was to not only do the
                            regular
                            things an Intern does, but to also use my knowledge of computers and IT to help out around
                            the
                            office.<br><br>While working at Nespon I became familiar with many Microsoft applications
                            such as
                            Microsoft
                            teams, Outlook, and SharePoint. But in my opinion the most important tool I learned at
                            Nespon
                            Solutions was Azure Active Directory. This tool is how Nespon Solutions manages its
                            employees and
                            it&#x27;s Microsoft tenant.<br><br>I became an admin for their system and received many
                            opportunities to
                            look
                            around the Azure AD application to identify what was possible and how I could help with the
                            companies IT needs. I was able to setup things like Single-Sign On (SSO), dynamic groups,
                            and I even
                            created a new SharePoint Site for the company. Working for Nespon Solutions opened my eye to
                            what IT
                            in the real world looks like and helped me understand what I wanted to learn more about.
