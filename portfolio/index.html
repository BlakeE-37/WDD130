                <h3>My Programming Knowledge</h3>
                <p>
                    The programming languages that I have experience with are Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, C#,
                    and Kotlin. Although I have used all of these languages in the past, I am much more comfortable in
                    languages such as Python, JavaScript and HTML. I am also well versed in GitHub and Git commands, and
                    I often use Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains Rider. Some other tools I am familiar with but
                    don&#x27;t
                    use often are Android Studio Code, and Arduino IDE.
                </p>
                <h3>My IT Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the summer of 2022, I was hired for an internship with the company, Nespon Solutions. This
                    company offers IT solutions to its clients, as they are a distributor of Salesforce and hire
                    Salesforce developers for their clients. My role at Nespon Solutions was to not only do the regular
                    things an Intern does, but to also use my knowledge of computers and IT to help out around the
                    office. While working at Nespon I became familiar with many Microsoft applications such as Microsoft
                    teams, Outlook, and SharePoint. But in my opinion the most important tool I learned at Nespon
                    Solutions was Azure Active Directory. This tool is how Nespon Solutions manages its employees and
                    it&#x27;s Microsoft tenant. I became an admin for their system and received many opportunities to
                    look
                    around the Azure AD application to identify what was possible and how I could help with the
                    companies IT needs. I was able to setup things like Single-Sign On (SSO), dynamic groups, and I even
                    created a new SharePoint Site for the company. Working for Nespon Solutions opened my eye to what IT
                    in the real world looks like and helped me understand what I wanted to learn more about.
